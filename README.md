Christmas Tree
===============

I found animated Christmas tree on reddit:

Was curious to make it in js. Current results are here: [Happy new  2019!](https://anvaka.github.io/atree/). Wish you all great successes and joy, doing what you love!

How it's built?
---------------
The tree is built of two spirals. These [11 lines of code](https://github.com/anvaka/atree/blob/2937249242a0204929aca45cdb8b937cfb5af3e5/index.js#L86-L97) render one line on spiral. It includes 3d projection and background shadow. _Almost_ the same as this [wiki image](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ComplexSinInATimeAxe.gif):

It's almost perfect now
-----------------------

**EDIT:** Thank you reddit. With your help we made it almost perfect. You are awesome! 

Huge appreciation goes to [@CensoredUsername](https://github.com/CensoredUsername) who made [significant improvement](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1tswai/t_sin_t_christmas_tree/cebhvu9). 

[@Yazuak](https://github.com/Yazuak) first gave and implemented [idea](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1tswai/t_sin_t_christmas_tree/cebajpt) of how to manage even distribution of points along the curves.

Vitaliy Kaurov implemented the same tree in Wolfram language... in just [15 lines of code](http://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/175891).

[David Librera](https://github.com/davidlibrera) rewrote this in CoffeeScript. Checkout [his repository](https://github.com/davidlibrera/atree/tree/master/js/coffee) for nice OO design. 

So, what's left? Just small changes which could make this tree perfect:

* Shadows are not accurate
* I think code is more complex than it should be (subjectively).
